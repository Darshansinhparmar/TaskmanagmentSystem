A Task Management System built in C++ that helps users organize and prioritize their tasks efficiently. The system allows users to create, view, update, delete, and sort tasks based on priority or due date. Tasks can be added with descriptions, deadlines, and priorities, and users can track progress over time.

The program is designed as a simple command-line application, making it easy to manage and maintain tasks for both personal and professional use.

View Tasks: View all tasks sorted by priority or deadline.
Update Tasks: Modify the priority or description of existing tasks.
Delete Tasks: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks from the system.
Sort Tasks: Sort tasks by due date or priority (high, medium, low).
Save and Load Data: Persist tasks to a file (tasks.txt) and load them on application start
